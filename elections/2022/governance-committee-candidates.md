#### Description of candidate ####

When not working on maintaining Acquia's internal Kubernetes as a Service platform, I contribute to Keptn and other open source projects. I believe in open communication, transparency, fact-based decision making and try-fail-learn loop. As someone who has made contributions to both Keptn code and community, here are some of the things I can offer:
1. Strive for what is best for Keptn i.e., do whatever it takes to help get the project to that next level
2. Ask (often difficult) questions
3. Act as a neutral party (my company has no vested interests in Keptn)

I try to be honest about what I don't know and I am always open to feedback.

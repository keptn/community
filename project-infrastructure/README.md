## Documentation

The Keptn repository is a monorepo with multiple sub-folders that contain microservices, the installer, Keptn Bridge,
and the `keptn` CLI.
As a starting point, please read the README files in the respective sub-folder. Also, take a look at the docs within the [docs/](docs/) folder in this repository.

We are aware that not every microservice has comprehensive documentation, so if you have any questions feel free to ask us in the [Keptn Slack workspace](https://slack.keptn.sh).

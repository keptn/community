Application guidelines and more information about Keptn
in GSoC are available on [this page](../README.md)

## 2023 Project Ideas

- [Keptn Plugin for Backstage](#keptn-backstage-plugin)
- [Create additional metrics operators for KLT](#keptn-additional-metrics)
- [Revamp the content and the aesthetics of the keptn.sh website](#keptn-website)

### Keptn Plugin for Backstage

[Backstage](https://backstage.io/) is an open platform for building developer portals. 
As the website states, "powered by a centralized software catalog,
Backstage restores order to your infrastructure and enables your product teams
to ship high-quality code quickly â€” without compromising autonomy".
It would be nice to provide Keptn integration for this portal
so that Keptn can connect as many as other tools. See all [Backstage Plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins).

A Possible solution could be a specialized plugin for Keptn using Keptn REST API and/or CLI.
It might be also possible to create a unified plugin for Keptn and other CI/CD tools, 
e.g. implemented on the top of the Cloud Events / CDEvents standard.

### Create additional metrics providers for KLT
The main idea of this project is to add additional metrics providers to the metrics controller. 

Proposed Outcome:
* Define metric providers which should be implemented
* Implement the proposed metric providers
* Test and document the usage of these metric providers

Future Work:
* There might be an SLO resource that utilizes metrics (when the SLO is based on a metric and timeframes are supported).

### Timeframes for Metrics
The main idea of this proposal is to make it possible to define timeframes for metrics and get standardized aggregated results for this timeframe.

Proposed Outcome:
* Propose a solution for this feature
* Define a metric based on a query and a timeframe
* Get the aggregated result for this timeframe and write the values to the status of the metric
* Also calculate min, max, avg, p25 and p75 for the metric
* Test and document the usage of this feature

Future Work:
* There might be an SLO resource that utilizes metrics (when the SLO is based on a metric and timeframes are supported).

### Revamp the content and the aesthetics of the keptn.sh website

Much of the content on the keptn.sh landing page has been unchanged for a while and needs to be updated to better reflect current projects, themes, and resources.

The look-and-feel of the page should be modernized.
Improve navigation throughout the site. For example, the KLT docs should have the same tabs at the top of the page as the Keptn V1 pages (currently, once you go to the KLT docs, you do not have a path back to the landing page or the Keptn V1 docs).
Make it so the contents in the left frame of content pages remains visible even when the user scrolls down a long page
Add a "Return to top" button for long content pages
Implement CLA to replace DCO and make it easier to contribute to the project.
Once CLA is implemented, add an "Improve this page" link to the displayed docs that pops the user into the github editor for the page and allows them to easily make simple edits and submit them as PRs that can be reviewed and merged.
Point to "Resources" that are current and implement a scheme that makes it easier to update those listings
Consider whether the Tutorials link on the
Consider a "banner" or some similar scheme that makes it easier to post current news and information, such as upcoming conferences, hackathons, et cetera

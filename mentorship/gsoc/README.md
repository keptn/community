# Google Summer of Code in Keptn

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global, online program focused on
bringing new contributors into open source software development.
GSoC contributors work with an open source organization on a
summer programming project under the guidance of mentors.

GSoC contributors accepted into the program receive a stipend, paid by Google,
to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Keptn project and its ecosystem.
In exchange, numerous community members volunteer as "mentors" for GSoC contributors 
to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed in completing their projects.

## GSoC 2022

Keptn participates in Google Summer of Code 2022!
We invite contributors to join us and to have a great experience this summer.
Our goal is to have great learning experiences for all participants.
We'll work together on strategic initiatives from the [Keptn Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/keptn/projects/1)
and new integrations highly anticipated by Keptn users.

### Joining as mentor

We welcome contributors to join the mentoring teams.
Each team, if a project is accepted,
will consist of 2 or more mentors and one participant selected by the mentors 
and GSoC admins during the application reviews.

**Expectations**. Mentors are expected to be experienced in the project idea domain
and to be willing to mentor students.
We expect mentors to dedicate several hour per week during the community bonding and coding phases.

## How does GSoC work in Keptn?

During the organization application phase,
we defined the top level framework about the GSoC framework in the Keptn organization.
See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MV7Y-_7vwgWfKwjDUemk_OOhQSt7qrp9RG9LSAQGGSE/edit?usp=sharing) for the details
we submitted to Google during the application.
Feel free to ask on the `#gsoc` Slack channel if you have any questions.

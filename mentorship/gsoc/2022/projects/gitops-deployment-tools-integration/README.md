GSoC 2022 - Integration for GitOps-based Deployment Tools (e.g. ArgoCD/Flux)
==========

To be able to use GitOps tools in combination with Keptn.
The main goal of this project is to find a proper way how the tools could interact with Keptn and to build an integration for such tools.
Deployment tools can be integrated via the helm-service or via the job-executor service.
Currently, thereâ€™s no way to integrate GitOps Tools in Keptn.
Provide a way such that such tools can be integrated into Keptn return deployment states after the state has been synced.

This project would be done in collaboration with Flux and Keptn maintainers.

GSoC 2022 - Integration for GitOps-based Deployment Tools (e.g. ArgoCD/Flux)
==========

To be able to use GitOps tools in combination with Keptn.
The main goal of this project is to find a proper way how the tools could interact with Keptn and to build an integration for such tools.
Deployment tools can be integrated via the helm service or via the job-executor service.
Currently, there’s no way to integrate GitOps Tools in Keptn.
Provide a way such that it could be integrated into Keptn return deployment states after the state has been synced.

This project would be done in collaboration with Flux and Keptn maintainers.

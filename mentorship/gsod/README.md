[Google Season of Docs (GSoD)](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) is an annual program by Google, providing an opportunity for technical writers to contribute to open-source software.
Season of Docs provides support for open source projects to improve their documentation and gives professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source.

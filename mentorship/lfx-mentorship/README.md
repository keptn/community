The Keptn community can host mentorship and outreach programs using 
[LFX Mentorship](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/).

## Scope

We can run LFX Mentorship projects on an ad-hoc basis,
assuming we have mentors and budgets available.
The projects may be focused on any area of open source contributions:
code, documentation, test automation, advocacy, community management, etc.

## Apply as a mentee

If you are interested in becoming in mentee,
reach out to us in the `#advocacy-and-outreach` channel or
in any working group channel
relevant to your project idea.
Usually LFX Mentorship is for established contributors
with proven background in open source communities.

If you are looking for possible project ideas,
check out our
[Google Summer of Code](../gsoc) and 
[Google Season of Docs](../docs)
project ideas
that have not been started yet.
Contributing to the initiatives from the
[Keptn Roadmap](https://keptn.sh/docs/roadmap/) could be also a good project for LFX Mentorship.
